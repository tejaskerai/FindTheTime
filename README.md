# Find-The-Time

## Overview 

Find-the-Time involved creating an android application that allows users to organize activities with friends and family that is seamless and uncomplicated. This is done by combining multiple user calendars together so that the organizer can pick a time and date that is suitable for everyone participating. The application also allows a user to organize two types of activities; choosing a movie and cinema theatre, and choosing a restaurant that is nearby using their postcode.
This project was part of my Final Year Project at University.
